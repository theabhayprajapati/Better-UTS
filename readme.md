# Better UTS App Clone


[![Development Pending](https://img.shields.io/badge/Development-Pending-yellow.svg)](#)

UTS is an incredible app provided by the Indian government that allows users to book local train tickets with ease and convenience, without having to endure long queues at the booking counter. While the app has proven to be incredibly useful, the user interface design could be improved. As a passionate developer, I have taken it upon myself to create a stunning and user-friendly interface for the UTS app, to make booking train tickets an even more enjoyable and hassle-free experience for users.
